Project to buy/sell 1$ worth of bitcoin when you click a dash button. Not included here is the basic lambda routing code to receive button press and fire the event off.

TODO
- add a fancy GDAX chart to index page
- generally style index page
- add socket (Pusher) for streaming in events
- debounce presses
- setup a “sell button”
